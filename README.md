For this project I used a component library https://allenfang.github.io/react-bootstrap-table/ to implement the requirement features - sorting, pagination, deletion. However, I discovered an incompatibility between the library version and bootstrap 4 that was causing the sort indicator arrows to not show up. I took a stab at implementing that myself, but in the interest of keeping the code cleaner, I discovered that downgrading both react-bootstrap-table and bootstrap to a lower version (Bootstrap 3) fixed the issues, the downside is that bootstrap 4 doesn’t support Flexbox however we do not need to use it for our case.  

I also used 2 different approaches to deduplicate uuid and content. The first approach uses JSON.stringify to serialize each message’s uuid and content and a Set to keep track duplicates. In the second approach, I put a set inside a hash map , the outer hash map will keep track of the uuids we’ve seen and a set of contents we associate with it, so we can filter out any messages that has our uuid in our hash map and the content inside the corresponding set. 

 After completion of the project, I was curious about how I would go about implementing this from scratch, and challenged myself to take a stab at it this library. This was a very fun challenge, but I decided not to include it because it is best practice to not reinvent the wheel when possible. If you are curious we can chat more about this approach during the interview!
